# Computational Interaction CHI 2017 course notes

These are the notes for the CHI 2017 course on Computational Approaches to Interaction Design. See the [full webpage](computationinteraction.org/chi17) for complete details of the course.


## Outline
This course introduces **computational methods for HCI.**
As interfaces become more sophisticated, designing them requires an exponentially expanding set of design decisions. Computational approaches are needed to synthesise elements of interfaces, to learn interaction structure from observations and to infer user intentions in a noisy world. Computational approaches empower HCI researchers to building sophisticated, robust interfaces quickly and reliably. 
            
       
###  Summary
The course covers:
    
* **Optimisation:** solving interaction problems by deriving interface configurations which satisfy constraints and maximize performance criteria.
* **Inference:** a principled and robust approach to designing a transformation from input to useful action.
            
This course will:

*  demonstrate how computational approaches can turn new technologies into viable interfaces while reducing inconsistency;
*  extend researchers' capabilities to build robust interactions across a wide range of contexts and devices;
*  show how computational approaches can focus interaction design on the interesting work of specifying the questions, and letting computational methods resolve the answers.

For a touchscreen keyboard this means that we need a model that assigns a probability to an individual $(x,y)$ touch point given a particular letter key hypothesis, that is $P(o_i|l_i)$. A simple way to achieve this is to centre a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution at each key centre and assume each 2D Gaussian has equal variance and that there is no correlation between the horizontal and vertical axes (that is, the covariance matrix is diagonal). To compute our likelihood distribution we need to compute the probability of observing a specific touch point for all possible $k$ letters that can be generated by the keyboard. For example, if our keyboard has two keys, say $A$ and $B$ generating the letters $a$ and $b$ respectively, then our likelihood distribution would need to be computed by computing the probability of the touch point for key $A$ and key $B$. If the touch point is centred at key $A$ the probability will be maximised for $A$ and smaller for $B$ (we assume keys do not overlap spatially)."
